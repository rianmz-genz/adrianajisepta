      "My name is Adrian Aji Septa. I am 18 years old. I am a fresh graduate from SMK N 1 Purwokerto majoring in Software Engineering and is currently studying at Amikom Purwokerto University. I love programming since I first learn it, especially in Frontend Dev. I like to create a clean, modern and of course fast performance website. Honestly, I am lacking of experience but I will learn and work harder to improve my skill and try to gain more experience over time.",
